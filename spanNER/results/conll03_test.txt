Polish brewer Zywiec 's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges , but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10-percent market share , the firm 's chief executive said .	Polish:: 0,1:: MISC:: MISC	Zywiec:: 2,6:: ORG:: ORG	
Company President Jean van Boxmeer told Reuters in an interview on Friday that the firm , whose net profit fell 77 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30-percent rise in sales , might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround .	Jean van Boxmeer:: 2,7:: PER:: PER	Reuters:: 8,9:: ORG:: ORG	
So far this year Zywiec , whose full name is Zaklady Piwowarskie w Zywcu SA , has netted six million zlotys on sales of 224 million zlotys .	Zywiec:: 4,8:: ORG:: ORG	
It has produced 1.5 million hectolitres .	
Van Boxmeer would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading Polish brewers should rise as the country 's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer .	Van Boxmeer:: 0,4:: PER:: PER	Polish:: 22,23:: MISC:: MISC	
" The perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable , " van Boxmeer said on Polish per-capita beer consumption , currently around 40 litres .	van Boxmeer:: 27,31:: O:: PER	Boxmeer:: 28,31:: PER:: O	Polish:: 33,34:: MISC:: MISC

Van Boxmeer said Poland 's top five brewers , which produce about 55 percent of the country 's beer , could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors .	Van Boxmeer:: 0,4:: PER:: PER	Poland:: 5,6:: LOC:: LOC

Van Boxmeer said the tough competition had prevented Zywiec from raising prices in line with inflation , which had added to the pressure on the firm 's margins .	Van Boxmeer:: 0,4:: PER:: PER	Zywiec:: 10,14:: ORG:: ORG	
He said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share .	
But he said the company 's investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade , largely in production , would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring Czech Republic .	Czech Republic:: 36,38:: LOC:: LOC	
Some analysts say cheaper but high-quality Czech imports could invade Poland once tariffs for CEFTA countries are lifted in 1998 , but van Boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the Czech beer market 's overcapacity .

Plastic surgery is booming , especially among men , as Brazilians spend much of their new-found wealth on the latest beauty treatments , said the organisers of a four-day international plastic surgery conference that opened on Friday .	Brazilians:: 10,12:: MISC:: MISC	
The number of plastic surgeries in Brazil has jumped 30 percent to an estimated 150,000 this year since an anti-inflation plan was introduced in July 1994 , Farid Hakme , the president of the Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society ( SBCP ) , said .	Brazil:: 7,8:: LOC:: LOC	Farid Hakme:: 32,37:: PER:: PER	Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society:: 42,46:: ORG:: ORG	SBCP:: 47,49:: ORG:: ORG	
The number of operations on men increased even more -- by 80 percent , from 8,000 in 1994 to 15,000 in 1995 , he said .	
" Brazil ranks right at the top for plastic surgery with respect to the number of surgeons , the number of patients , number of operations , number of conferences .	Brazil:: 1,2:: LOC:: LOC	
Our statistics are the highest for everything , " Hakme said .	Hakme:: 9,12:: PER:: PER	
" We believe the increase in plastic surgeries for men results from the difficulties in the job market .	
People need to have a more youthful look to compete in the job market , given the profound changes in Latin America 's economy . "	Latin America:: 20,22:: LOC:: LOC	
A controlled exchange rate , trade liberalisation and tight monetary policies have also dramatically curbed inflation , making more money available for cosmetic surgery .	
Brazil has been at the forefront in plastic surgery for decades and is home to one of the most famous surgeons , Ivo Pitangy .	Brazil:: 0,1:: LOC:: LOC	Ivo Pitangy:: 22,26:: PER:: PER	
There are 6,000 plastic surgeons there , of which 4,500 have qualified to be members of the SBCP .	SBCP:: 21,23:: ORG:: ORG	
Every year , 500 new plastic surgeons graduate in Brazil and medical students from all over the world come to study there .	Brazil:: 9,10:: LOC:: LOC	
Hakme attributes Brazil 's fascination with plastic surgery not to excessive vanity but to the country 's mix and match of different races , which can create physical disharmonies . "	Hakme:: 0,3:: PER:: PER	Brazil:: 4,5:: LOC:: LOC	
What happens is the nose sometimes does n't match the mouth or the buttocks do n't match with the legs , " he said .	
Brazil 's most sought-after beauty treatment is liposuction in which fat is sucked away from areas of the body , with about 30,000 operations a year at a cost of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 each .	Brazil:: 0,1:: LOC:: LOC	
Stomach tucks and breast operations are also popular since the tropical climate calls for flesh-baring fashions , but unlike women elsewhere Brazilians tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants .	Brazilians:: 26,28:: MISC:: MISC	
" The women who want to reduce their breasts here would probably want to increase them in the United States , " SBCP Vice-President Oswaldo Saldanha said . "	United States:: 18,20:: LOC:: LOC	SBCP:: 22,24:: ORG:: ORG	Oswaldo Saldanha:: 27,32:: PER:: PER

Indian rubber demand is seen outpacing local production in the 1996/97 April / March season and the trend will persist way into the next century , the chairman of the Rubber Board of India said on Friday .	Indian:: 0,1:: MISC:: MISC	Rubber Board of India:: 34,38:: ORG:: ORG	
K.J. Matthew said at the Asia Rubber Markets meeting here Indian production of natural rubber in 1996/97 will reach 547,000 tonnes against projected demand of 578,000 tonnes , a gap of 31,000 tonnes .	K.J. Matthew:: 0,5:: PER:: PER	Asia Rubber Markets meeting:: 8,12:: MISC:: O	Indian:: 13,14:: MISC:: MISC	
For synthetic rubber , production reached 68,200 tonnes in 1995/96 while consumption in the same season hit 134,085 tonnes , Matthew added .	Matthew:: 27,28:: PER:: PER	
" Though schemes designed to realise further increases in the production of natural rubber are being operated successfully , the demand-supply gap is expected to widen , " he said .	
Indian synthetic rubber output is not expected to rise significantly in the next season but demand will rise to 145,000 tonnes .	Indian:: 0,1:: MISC:: MISC	
Matthew estimates that by the 2000/01 season , the gap between natural rubber output and consumption will rise to 51,000 tonnes and 319,000 tonnes in 2010/11 .	Matthew:: 0,1:: PER:: PER	
Natural rubber production will go up to 695,000 tonnes in 2000/01 against consumption of 746,000 tonnes .	
In 2010/11 , domestic demand should rise further to 1.233 million tonnes while production will only reach about 914,000 tonnes .	
One way to bridge the widening gap is to put more land under cultivation which the Rubber Board official estimates will reach 220,000 hectares between now and the year 2003 although Matthew said this may not be possible at this time in India .	Rubber Board:: 16,18:: ORG:: ORG	Matthew:: 33,34:: PER:: PER	India:: 44,45:: LOC:: LOC	
" The development objective for the rubber plantation industry will be to increase production to the best extent possibly with a view to minimising imports of natural rubber , " he said .

As many as 1 million dog bites are recorded in the United States every year and half of them are provoked by humans , a veterinarian told fellow animal doctors on Friday .	United States:: 11,13:: LOC:: LOC	
The Humane Society of the United States estimates that between 500,000 and one million bites are delivered by dogs each year , more than half of which are suffered by children .	United States:: 5,7:: LOC:: O

" Let 's not let our kids jump on them or crawl on them .	
Dogs and children do n't have to have an interaction .	
Let 's respect their territories , " he said .	
Cornwell said 50 percent of reported bites were provoked by a person and 60 percent were suffered by children .	Cornwell:: 0,2:: PER:: PER	
He also estimated that only 25 percent of bites were reported because medical attention was not needed .	
Don Rieck , president of the National Animal Control Association , said aggressiveness in dogs was related more to gender than breed and a male dog that had not been neutered was three times more likely to bite than an unspayed female .	Don Rieck:: 0,3:: PER:: PER	National Animal Control Association:: 7,11:: ORG:: ORG
